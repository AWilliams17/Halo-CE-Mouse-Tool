## Note before downloading source
This project uses two of my libraries - [Registrar](https://github.com/AWilliams17/Registrar), and [SharpUtils](https://github.com/AWilliams17/SharpUtils), both of which are not currently on Nuget.org. You will have to set up both in order to play with the source.

This can be done by recursively cloning the repository:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/AWilliams17/Halo-CE-Mouse-Tool.git
```
