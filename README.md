# Halo-CE-Mouse-Tool
This tool was made in an effort to finally destroy the one thing that is a bane to all FPS players: Mouse Acceleration.

Halo Custom Edition has built in Mouse Acceleration that you can not turn off. Until now.

This tool will allow you to smite the Mouse Acceleration and destroy it. Not only that, but it also will allow you
to customize your sensitivity to anything you want - be it 1.3, 2.4, 4.421, etc. Halo's normal customization
menu doesn't allow this.

But it goes even further - if you want to just customize your sensitivity, but leave acceleration on (for some reason),
you can do that!

There are two methods available to you:
	1: Patch it via the regular mouse tool, which must be opened everytime you want to enable the changes. The tool automatically saves any
	of your settings on exit so you don't have to keep putting it in everytime you open it back up.
	
	2: From the mouse tool, you can deploy a DLL along with a settings application for the DLL which will allow you to get around having
	to open up any external applications everytime you want to play Halo with custom mouse settings. All you must do is just open
	the DLL settings application after pressing the "deploy DLL" button from the mouse tool, set your desired settings, and then
	go into Halo and press F1 to use the settings. Easy.
	
So yeah.
