# Halo-CE-Mouse-Tool
This tool was made in an effort to finally destroy the one thing that is a bane to all FPS players: Mouse Acceleration.

Halo Custom Edition has built in Mouse Acceleration that you can not turn off. Until now.

This tool will allow you to smite the Mouse Acceleration and destroy it. Not only that, but it also will allow you
to customize your sensitivity to anything you want - be it 1.3, 2.4, 4.421, etc. Halo's normal customization
menu doesn't allow this.

But it goes even further - if you want to just customize your sensitivity, but leave acceleration on (for some reason),
you can do that!

New in version 4 is a configuration file, which automatically saves your settings when you close the tool,
and loads it when you launch it, so you no longer have to reset all your settings. Just launch the tool,
go in game, hit the hotkey you have set (if you enabled it), or hit the activate button!
