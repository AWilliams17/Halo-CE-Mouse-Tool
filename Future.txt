Future Features:
-Let +/- keys add/subtract from sensitivity to allow fine tuning of sensitivity whilst ingame
-Let user change update timeout
-Maybe make XML be loaded/saved to Halo Custom Edition folder if the location if the install can be found?
-Automatically write to memory when Halo is detected?
