Future Features:
-Let +/- keys add/subtract from sensitivity to allow fine tuning of sensitivity whilst ingame
-Maybe make XML be loaded/saved to Halo Custom Edition folder if the location if the install can be found?
-Automatically write to memory when Halo is detected?
-Automatically launch Halo CE when the tool starts? (although this will prevent SPV3 from being launched. might be a way around that?)
-Add a bottle opener
-Embed a DLL into the tool, if the user wishes to, they can have this DLL get pasted into the controls directory in Halo,
which will patch the sensitivity that way.
