# Halo-Mouse-Tool Help  
## Compatibility
This tool was developed using the latest Halo CE release coupled with Open Sauce.  
It should work though even without Open Sauce.
## Disabling Mouse Acceleration  
Upon pressing the ```WRITE TO MEMORY``` button, mouse acceleration will automatically be disabled.  
When Halo is restarted, acceleration will once again be present.  
## Hotkeys  
To enable the usage of hotkeys, and to specify which hotkey you want to use,  
go to ```File->Settings``` to reach this window  
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/vplrskF.png)  
Then, press the ```Hotkey``` checkbox to enable the hotkey (default is F1). To change the hotkey,  
simply press the textbox next to the checkbox and press the key you want to use.  
## +/- Increment keys  
To further fine-tune your mouse sensitivity, you can enable the +/- increment hotkeys in the settings window.  
Then, while ingame, press the '+' key to add the value in the ```Increment Amount``` textbox to  
both the ```x``` and ```y``` sensitivity values, and press the '-' key to lower them by that amount.  
## Updating  
The updater in Halo Mouse Tool is admittedly a little rough around the edges (and is slated for a rework).

The ```Timeout(seconds)``` value controls how long after pressing the ```CHECK FOR UPDATES``` button the request to GitHub will timeout after.  
If the current version of the tool you're using does not match that of the most recently released version on the GitHub, then a message box   
will pop up with a link to the download page.  
Otherwise it'll tell you there's no updates available. Simple as that.
## Halo Combat Evolved  
To use this tool with Halo Combat Evolved, simply hit the Game dropdown button from the main menu and select  
Halo Combat Evolved, then use the tool as you normally would with Halo CE. Do note though, Halo Combat Evolved  
is very old, and while I kind of got it working, it is prone to crashing when using this tool. I plan on fixing this in a later release,  
but right now it's on the back of the priority list.
## HAC2  
I have not tested this tool with HAC2. I have played on servers using it and the tool and have been fine though.  
Let me know if you run into any issues.
## HotKeys aren't working  
Make sure the Settings window is closed, and you've ticked the hotkey checkbox there as well.
